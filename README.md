## WeatherPy
**Data:** a seeded uniform random generator was used to get a random sample set of 1500 coordinates, CitiPy successfully filtered the random coordinates to a sample set of 583 cities, that then succesfully returned a sample set of 578 entries of city weather data from https://openweathermap.org/current. This data was used to look at various weather data in relation to latitudes to look for any emergent patterns.
