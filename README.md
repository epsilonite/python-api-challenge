# WeatherPy + VacationPy
## WeatherPy
A seeded uniform random generator was used to get a random sample set of 1500 coordinates, `CitiPy` successfully filtered the random coordinates to a sample set of 583 cities, that then succesfully returned a sample set of 578 entries of city weather data from `OpenWeather API` (https://openweathermap.org/current). This data was used to look at various weather data in relation to latitudes to look for any emergent patterns.
## VacationPy
City data was read from the csv file generated by `WeatherPy` and mapped using `hvplot`. For vacation, the cities are filtered for max temperatures betweeen 22°C and 27°C and humidity below 80%. For each remaining city, `Geoapify API` (https://api.geoapify.com/v2/places) was used to locate hotels then any accomodations within 10km, then merged with `countries_iso3166b.csv` from https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html to derive common country names from the iso2 country codes, then displayed on `hvplot`.
